# ObfuscatorDoJ

Hello DoJ Software team, man I do not know where to start with this project let me tell you. Most of the code / some things in the current code you're reading have been removed for security and or general irrelevance, that be some web links or api links etc. 

**THIS CODE IS MESSY, AND GARBAGE.**

As for obf-dotnet, **ALOT** of junk was removed to specifcally fit the 100 file upload limit. This code is messy but shows great methods and "security". (Lua files, Loretta, GParse)

This was created as a Lua VM based obfuscator, to essentially hide your code from a readable eye. This was leaked by a internal developer of mine essentially right after we had completed the project. The developer did not help with this project, as he was a web-based html guy only. This project was sold to people without my permission and without any forum of acknowledgement by me.
